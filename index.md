## HL7 Belgium process documentation

This publication contains the processes used by HL7 Belgium in the definition and publication of HL7 FHIR standards in Belgium.  
It contains the key artifacts, the roles, and the general way of working within the strict scope of HL7 Belgium working groups.

This interfaces with other stakeholders that play a role in creating and publishing standards - namely eHealth, the Program Board B, the different federal working groups - Architecture and Structuring Elements, as well as the broad community. While those adjacent processes are identified here, this documentation does not represent those other processes - this documentation site maintains only the HL7 processes and technologies; all other processes are the responsibility of the respective owners, and are just identified here for a clear understanding of the collaboration.
